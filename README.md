# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms** repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms, implementations, and explanations designed to help you understand and implement various ML techniques. 

## Overview

This repository includes algorithms from different areas of machine learning, such as:

- **Supervised Learning**: Classification and regression algorithms.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms for training agents through rewards.

Each algorithm is provided with its implementation in code, a brief explanation, and, where applicable, example usage.
